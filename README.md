# CESA GIT WORKSHOP
Welcome to CESA Git Workshop activity.

- In this activity, you will be grouped in teams with 5 members.
- There are **5** branches in this repo. The branches' names are **frontend**, **backend**, **design**, **business**, and **master**.
- The master branch is for me myself.
- Each group of people should be assigned to one branch.
- There are only room for 20 people in this repo, so based on the number of people attending this activity, 1 or 2 of you should clone this repo and use their account.

## TASKS:
- The **frontend** branch task is to upload 5 different html files to the frontend branch and make a pull request to merge with master.
- The **backend** branch task is to upload 5 different python source code files to the backend branch and make a pull request to merge with master.
- The **design** branch task is to upload 5 different photos to the design branch and make a pull request to merge with master.
- The **business** branch task is to upload 5 different excel files to the business branch and make a pull request to merge with master.

**BE SURE TO USE "git checkout" AND DO NOT COMMIT ON THE master BRANCH!**
